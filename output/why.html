<p>Patrick: Well, </p>
<ol>
<li>I believe in prototyping things as rapidly as possible. </li>
<li>I also believe in flat text files. And LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Markdown.</li>
<li>Git is the best system ever invented for managing large text files across a distributed team. And scripts are just large text files. It just make sense to my brain that that we should use git and/or github to manage the massive amount of story and script. </li>
</ol>
<p>You can't search across a directory of word docs. Or do find and replace across them. It's also not easy to chunk up word docs and feed them to an LLM for Document Assisted Retrieval. but if we had ALL of the documents in flat files we could do all of that and more. </p>
<p>And we could probably parse it into OEI so some poor bastard doesn't waste their life retyping a smell writer's word doc. </p>
