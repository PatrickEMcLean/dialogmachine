        <h1>Learning How to Use Dialog Machine</h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
<p><em>Patrick, hunched over his computer struggles to make a useful tool for writing interactive dialog. He jumps slightly as you enter the room, but then, recognizing you, he smile and begins to speak.</em></p>
<h2>dialog:</h2>
<p>Patrick: This is a simple tool to preview interactive dialogs. In the root folder you will find a file called dialog.md. It's a valid <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">markdown file.</a>  So you can edit that file with any text editor you like. Just make sure it's saved as plain text  with an .md ending</p>
<p>When you run render.py by entering this in Powershell or the Mac Terminal</p>
<p><code>python render.py</code></p>
<p>The script then reads the dialog file, creating a unique page for every section of markdown inbetween the dash delimiters. But, if you put links in the text file (and/or images) you can build a clickable preview of interactive dialog simply by typing. Which is cool.</p>
<p>You: So what do I do now?</p>
<p>Patrick: You have choices.</p>
<h1>choices:</h1>
<p><a href="file_structure.html">How is the dialog file is structured?</a></p>
<p><a href="whats_next.html">Love it, what's next?</a></p>
<p><a href="weird.html">Jesus, you're weird!</a></p>
